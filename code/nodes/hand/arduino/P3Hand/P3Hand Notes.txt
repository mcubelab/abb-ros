P3 Hand Notes

With the palm installed, there are just slightly more than 30,000 (~30,100) motor angles between the fully open and fully closed positions.

The motor is zeroed at the position it's in when the Arduino is powered on. 

Do not unplug the Arduino from the computer while it's streaming data. This has crashed the computer a couple times.
