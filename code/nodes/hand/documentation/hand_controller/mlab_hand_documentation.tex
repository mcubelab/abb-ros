\section{Introduction}
In this document, we discuss the MLab Simple Hand, and how to control and receive data from it.

\subsection{Hardware Description}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figures/MLabHand.jpg}
\caption{The MLab Simple Hand}
\label{fig:hand}
\end{figure}

The MLab Simple Hand (Figure~\ref{fig:hand}) has 1 motor for actuation connected to 3 compliantly linked fingers. There is an encoder connected to each of the fingers to get angle information. As each finger is connected to the motor with a spring, given the finger position and motor position, the torque exerted by each finger can also be computed. The hand also has a force sensing palm which allows the user to measure the normal force into the palm and 2 torques around the planar directions on top of the palm. 

The hand is controlled via a USB connection, and must also be connected to a 6V power supply to power the motor. The hand uses an Arduino as its central processor, and thus code can be modified at any time.

\subsection{Angles, Forces, Directions}
Here, we explain the meaning of terms used in the rest of the document.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Finger Angle:} The angle a finger makes with respect to the hand. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hand_diagram}, 0 corresponds to the finger being wide open, $\pi/2$ corresponds to the finger being straight up, and $\pi$ corresponds to the finger being parallel with the palm. Normal values will be around $(\pi/2, \pi)$.
\item \textbf{Motor Angle:} The motor is controlled by encoder counts, but the \emph{motor angle} is the position of the motor for a nominal finger angle. For example, if we specify a motor angle of $2\pi/3$, this will move the motor so that the finger angles will be $2\pi/3$ in the absence of collision or external forces.
\item \textbf{Opening and Closing:} As we increase angle, the fingers close. As we increase the motor encoder count, the hand closes as well. It takes a little over 10000 encoder counts to go from fully open to fully closed.
\item \textbf{Finger torques:} As we push or pull the finger from its nominal location, it exerts a force because of the springs compliantly linking it to the motor. This can be expressed as a torque about the finger rotation axis. We will say that the finger torque is positive if the finger is being pressed open, and negative if the finger is being pulled closed.
\item \textbf{Palm forces and torques:} We can measure planar torques and the normal force using our force sensing palm. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hand_diagram}, the $x$-axis corresponds to the vector drawn from the center of the palm out towards the center of the motor (exactly opposite of a finger). The $z$-axis points outwards, and the $y$-axis is specified using the right-hand rule. When we report torques, they will be about the $x$ and $y$ axes, and when we report the normal force, it will be in the $-z$ direction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State Machine}

The hand operates using a very simple state machine, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:state_machine}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/state_machine.pdf}
\caption{The state machine used by the hand}
\label{fig:state_machine}
\end{figure}

There are 5 states. Disabled (0), Target (1), Braked (2), Calibrate (3), and Demo (4). The numbers in parentheses next to each state is the value that will be returned when the hand is queried for its current state. The table below explains each of the states in more detail: \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{0.8\textwidth}|}
\hline
\textbf{State Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Disabled & In this state, the motor controlling the hand is disconnected. It can be moved freely by hand. The hand must be enabled before any motion commands can be executed. The hand can be move to the disabled state from any other state. \\ \hline
Target & This is the main motion state. In this state, the hand is servoed to a target position. If the hand is not calibrated, only encoder target commands can be issued. \\ \hline
Braked & In this state, the hand is braked by ``connecting" the leads of the motor together. No power is used and it is harder to turn the motor, but not as strong as when in the Target state. \\ \hline
Calibrate & The hand calibrates itself when in this state. As the motor has an incremental encoder, the encoder is reset by moving the hand to a hard stop. Until the hand is calibrated, finger angles and torques cannot be computed, and no angular motor commands may be issued. \\ \hline
Demo & In this state, we can close and open the hand by pressing on the force sensor. We can only enter this state once the hand has been calibrated. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\pagebreak

\section{Control Reference}
The hand is controlled using a serial interface over the USB connection, with a baud rate of 115200. The hand can accept and reply to commands and queries, stream data, and report errors and information.

\subsection{Input}
All commands sent to the hand must look like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
command [arg1] [arg2] ... #
\end{verbatim}


\noindent Below we list possible commands to send to the hand with any necessary arguments:\\

\begin{tabular}{l|p{0.8\textwidth}}

\verb;stream <value>#; & Sets up what values to stream. \verb;<value>; is a single character whose 8 bits are a bit array which represent what data to stream. \\


\end{tabular}

\subsection{Streaming Output}
The stream command takes in a single character whose 8 bits are a bit array. Each bit represents a type of data to stream. If it is set to 1, that type of data will be streamed, and if set to 0, it will not. By default, the stream register is initially set to all zeros. We use 8 bits to create our character, with the lowest bit being bit 1, and highest being bit 8:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
bit 1 & Motor Angle \\ \hline
bit 2 & Motor Encoder \\ \hline
bit 3 & Finger Angles \\ \hline
bit 4 & Finger Encoders \\ \hline
bit 5 & Palm Sensors \\ \hline
bit 6 & Palm Forces \\ \hline
bit 7 & Finger Torques \\\hline
bit 8 & Unused \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\\

\noindent Based on the current stream register, different data will be sent over the serial port from the hand. All of the data will be sent back with the following form:
\begin{verbatim}
#X<data>&
\end{verbatim}
where \verb;#; is the start of the mesage, \verb;X; is the data identifier, and \verb;&; is the end of a message. \\

\noindent We list the possible data types and the format of the messages sent back below:\\

\begin{tabular}{l|p{0.8\textwidth}}

\hline
\verb;#O<ang>&; & Motor angle (radians). \verb;<ang>; is 4 characters long, representing a number with 3 decimal places. (1.234 $\rightarrow$ 1234). \\

\verb;#T<t1><t2><t3>&; & Finger torques. Format of \verb;<t*>; are tbd. \\

\end{tabular}


\subsection{Response Output}
When a command from the input section is sent to the hand, a response is generated and sent back from the hand. All responses are of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
#QX<message>&
\end{verbatim}
where \verb;#; is the start of the message, \verb;Q; indicates a response, \verb;X; is the message identifier, and \verb;&; is the end of a message. \\
