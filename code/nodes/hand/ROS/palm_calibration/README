    Task node to calibrate the P3 force sensing palm.  This uses
    the robot arm to position the palm against a table-mounted
    force sensor to measure the spring function and calibrate the
    analog inputs.


src/palm_calibration.cpp	node to run a calibration using the robot arm to press the palm against the force sensor and collect data
src/calibration_motion.cpp	subsidiary node to operate the robot arm movement for palm_calibration

octave/*			Octave scripts to process the raw data into a calibration matrix.
octave/calibration		       the most recently computed calibration
octave/fit_sensor_calibration.m        compute the calibration matrix to transform sensor values to 3-axis wrench
octave/fit_spring_function.m	       fit the palm spring function to the raw data (not needed for operation)
octave/force_sensor_center.m	       utility script to compute the force sensor location from edge points
octave/load_calibration_data.m	       utility script to load a raw calibration data set
octave/makeplots.m		       generate plot data and plot various calibration curves	       
octave/{data|log}		       symbolic links to most recent calibration files
octave/plots			       symbolic link to plot data folder


launch/*			Launch files for testing the calibration system in different configurations.


src/echo_force.cpp		utility node for checking that the force sensor node is sending data
nodes/echo_ATI_force_sensor.py	Python script to demonstrate reading the force sensor node output

================================================================
basic usage:

launch these nodes:
  palm_calibration 
  calibration_motion
  netft_node

[for testing, dry_run.launch will start just these]

The nodes will sit quiescent.  Make sure the robot is at the
exact prerequisite pose (see safe_pose[] in
calibration_motion.cpp), then issue this service call:

rosservice call /palm_calibration/startCalibration
